configuration files for my linux setup

# Once you have installed Oh My Zsh, ensure to map to config files into the newly created .zshrc file:
`source ~/linux-config/zsh/zsh.config` in your ~/.zshrc file

# Note also that installing Oh My Zsh will overwrite any existing directory, and so you'll need to replace any custom themes in .oh-my-zsh/themes

# Vim
# The following will need to be added to a new .vimrc file in the home directory for vim to detect these settings:
# "source /home/samuel/linux-config/vim/vim.config"
